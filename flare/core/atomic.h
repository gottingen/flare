/// \brief Atomic functions
///
/// This header file defines prototypes for the following atomic functions:
///   - exchange
///   - compare and exchange
///   - add
///
/// Supported types include:
///   - signed and unsigned 4 and 8 byte integers
///   - float
///   - double
///
/// They are implemented through GCC compatible intrinsics, OpenMP
/// directives and native CUDA intrinsics.
///
/// Including this header file requires one of the following
/// compilers:
///   - NVCC (for CUDA device code only)
///   - GCC (for host code only)
///   - Intel (for host code only)
///   - A compiler that supports OpenMP 3.1 (for host code only)
